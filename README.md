## Technical
This template is currently being used at [phillipian.net](http://phillipian.net/), hosted on Dreamhost. Changes are deployed to Dreamhost manually via FTP (WinSCP Folder Synchronization feature), so what's on the website may not be up to date with the repository, or the other way around.

For development purposes, I ([@wwsalmon](https://github.com/wwsalmon)) recommend setting up a Wordpress installation with MAMP and cloning this repo into the Wordpress installation's themes folder.
